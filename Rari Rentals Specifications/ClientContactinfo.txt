Hello Rory 


Yes maybe that could be considered in a phase 2, I realised we might not have the budget for any changes at this point anyway 

Thank You

Hi Rizwana,

Thank you for providing the information.

We will currently be working on an email and telephone link, as well as displaying the company address.

Would it be possible to add in the “How did you hear about us?” feature in a future Sprint?

Thank you for your consideration.

Regards,
Rory Harmsworth
